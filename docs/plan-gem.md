# Strategic Plan for G Productions Japan (合同会社)

This document outlines a strategic approach for establishing and positioning G Productions Japan 合同会社 alongside the existing G Productions, LLC (USA).

## 1. Overall Structure & Relationship

*   **G Productions, LLC (USA):** Primarily focus on global products (e.g., App Store apps), international client services (agency work billed in USD), and holding intellectual property where appropriate. Acts as the global brand umbrella.
*   **G Productions Japan 合同会社 (GK):** Focus specifically on the Japanese market. Target Japanese clients for consulting, agency services, technical advisory (`技術顧問`), AI agent development, and SaaS/App solutions tailored to local needs. This entity will handle contracts and billing within Japan (JPY).
*   **Collaboration:** Position the two entities as collaborative parts of the same global brand, leveraging shared expertise, resources, and the "G Productions" identity. This allows the Japanese entity to benefit from the perceived stability and reach of the US entity, while the US entity gains a dedicated presence in Japan.

## 2. Branding & Positioning (Japan)

*   **Company Name:** `G Productions Japan 合同会社` is clear and directly links to the established brand. Alternatives like `G Productions 合同会社` are possible, but adding "Japan" provides helpful market context. Avoid overly generic Japanese names to maintain the link to the existing brand.
*   **Positioning:**
    *   **Avoid "Single CEO" Perception:** Emphasize a "studio," "agency," or "consulting group" model. Use plural pronouns ("we," "our team") in communications. Highlight the range of services to suggest a broader capability than a single freelancer.
    *   **Core Focus:** Heavily promote AI Agent development, AI Solutions, Technical Advisory (`技術顧問`), and custom Software/SaaS/App development for the Japanese market.
    *   **Messaging:** Combine "Global Expertise, Local Focus." Highlight access to cutting-edge AI (linking implicitly to the broader G Productions effort) applied specifically to solve Japanese business challenges. Stress partnership, collaboration, and tailored solutions. Use terms like:
        *   AIソリューションスタジオ (AI Solution Studio)
        *   デジタルトランスフォーメーションパートナー (Digital Transformation Partner)
        *   先端技術コンサルティンググループ (Advanced Technology Consulting Group)
*   **Trust Building:** Leverage the existence of the US LLC as a sign of stability and international presence. Clearly define the Japanese entity's role and commitment to the local market. Prepare Japanese case studies or testimonials as soon as possible.

## 3. Online Presence Strategy

*   **Domain:** Utilize the existing `g-productions.studio` domain for brand consistency.
*   **Website Structure:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Use language/region subdirectories:
        * use the g-productions.studio root to redirect based on language user agent
        *   `g-productions.studio/ja/` for the primary Japanese site, targeting Japanese clients and detailing Japan-specific services/focus.
        *   `g-productions.studio/en/` () for the global/US audience, focusing on LLC services, global products (apps), and potentially linking to the Japanese site for regional information.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Japanese Site (`/ja/`):** Must be fully localized in Japanese. Content should reflect the positioning outlined above (agency/consulting focus, AI, technical advisory for JP market). Clearly state it's operated by G Productions Japan 合同会社. Include Japanese contact information and address.
    *   **English Site (`/en/` or `/`):** Focus on G Productions, LLC services, global portfolio, apps, and contact info for international inquiries. Can mention the Japanese branch as part of the global network.

## 4. Japanese Company Registration (合同会社 - GK 登記)

Registering a 合同会社 (GK) is generally simpler and less expensive than a 株式会社 (KK). Here's information regarding the registration, particularly the `事業目的` (Business Objectives):

*   **Entity Type:** 合同会社 (Godo Kaisha - GK)
*   **Key Requirements (Consult a Professional!):**
    *   **Company Name (商号):** G Productions Japan 合同会社 (or chosen name)
    *   **Registered Office Address (本店所在地):** A physical address in Japan.
    *   **Members (社員):** Names and addresses of all members (investors).
    *   **Representative Member (代表社員):** At least one must be designated. Must have an address in Japan.
    *   **Capital (資本金):** Minimum 1 JPY, but a realistic amount is recommended (e.g., 100,000 JPY to 1,000,000 JPY or more depending on needs).
    *   **Articles of Incorporation (定款):** Needs to be drafted and notarized (though GK notarization rules are simpler than KK).
    *   **Business Objectives (事業目的):** A list of activities the company intends to pursue.

*   **Drafting `事業目的` (Business Objectives):**
    *   Be broad enough to cover current and future activities but specific enough to be accepted by the Legal Affairs Bureau (法務局).
    *   It's crucial to get these right initially, as changes require a registration update and fees.
    *   **Recommended List (Based on your input & `company.md`):**
